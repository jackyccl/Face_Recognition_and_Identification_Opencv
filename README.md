# face_recognition_and_identification_opencv
This is a small project that shows how to implement open CV with python to do facial recognition and facial identification.

Face recognition is just pulling out faces in a video or image. Face identification is somehow different from face recognition in which it can be illustrated as a bounding box around a face with that person's name on it as shown below.

### Note that the images in the "images" file can be added to have a better result. Those images are just meant for references and testing purposes.

At the end, I will have two different python modules, which one dedicated towards training using LBPH Face REcognizer and another referred to not only recognizing but also identifying faces in a video.

However, the facial identification and recognition can be advanced using deep learning library. In this project, I will be only using openCV built-in features to train the faces. More to come in the next project using other advanced deep learning techniques.
